makeing desicions with the  while loop
playing again is an example of that
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
char again = ’y’;
while (again == ’y’)
{
cout << "\n**Played an exciting game**";
cout << "\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): ";
cin >> again;
}
cout << "\nOkay, bye.";
return 0;
}
continue : means jump back to the top of the loop
break : jump out from the code block
